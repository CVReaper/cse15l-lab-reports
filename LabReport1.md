What happens when I do no arguments for:

CD:

Starting at /home :
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$
```
Starting from /home/lecture1
```
[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ 
```
Prior to using the cd command, I set the directory to /home/lecture1. After running the cd command, without any arguments, it brought us back to /home. However, if you were to do this while already at /home, nothing would occur as you already at home.
